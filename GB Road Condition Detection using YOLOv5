📜 Project Overview
This project aims to leverage YOLOv5 for detecting and classifying road conditions to help identify hazards, such as potholes, cracks, or other irregularities. With an emphasis on real-time detection, this system could be utilized in smart transportation systems or road maintenance programs to enhance road safety and maintenance.

🚀 Features
YOLOv5-based Detection: Uses the YOLOv5 architecture for efficient object detection, tailored specifically for road condition assessment.
Real-time Processing: Capable of detecting and classifying road conditions in real-time scenarios.
Easy Deployment: Configurable for integration with edge devices or cloud services, enabling
flexible deployment in a range of environments.
Customizable Classes: Supports additional classes or categories for road condition detection as per specific requirements.
📂 Project Structure
data/ - Contains training and validation datasets.
The dataset used includes images of road surfaces with various conditions, labeled for training the YOLOv5 model. For custom datasets, use the data_processing.py script to format your data.
