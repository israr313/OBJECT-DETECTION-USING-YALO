Welcome to the Road Condition Detection Using YOLOv5 project! This project leverages YOLOv5, a popular object detection model, to identify and categorize road conditions to enhance safety and improve infrastructure management.
Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting various road conditions, such as:

Potholes
Cracks
Uneven Surfaces
Road Obstacles
By using YOLOv5's deep learning-based object detection framework, this project aims to accurately identify these conditions in real-time from images or video feeds.

Key Features
Efficient Detection: Uses the YOLOv5 architecture, known for its speed and accuracy, to detect road conditions.
Real-Time Processing: Capable of processing images and video feeds in real-time.
Customizable: Easily adaptable for different types of road condition datasets.
Setup and Requirements
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/road-condition-detection
Install the necessary dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the notebook: Open the Jupyter notebook and execute each cell to train and test the model.
Getting Started
Dataset Preparation: Use a dataset with labeled road conditions. Preprocess it as required by YOLOv5.
Training: Train the YOLOv5 model with the custom dataset.
Inference: Run inference on new data to detect road conditions.
Results
The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated based on metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score, with visual outputs to illustrate detected conditions on test images.
